Source files:
- Test_sample.c contains: * data_max & data_min that are used to normalize the test sample
                          * one test sample of size 40 x 16 (i.e., 40 datum from each of the 16 sensor)

- cnn_params.c contains: * the weights and biases for the 1D-convultional layers
                         * the weights and biases of the single-hidden and output layers of the fully connected neural network.
                         
- Conv.c correpsonds to the 1D convolutional layer function.
- Avg_pool.c corresponds to the average pooling layer function.
- flatten.c correponds to the flatining function.
- Fully_connected.c correponds to two fully connected layers (first layer with fused ReLU).
- sofmax.c correponds to the softmax function.
